# Welcome to the SAP CAP & Amazon Simple Notification Service Integration App

## Description
This is an example project showcases how to integrate SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) with Amazone Simple Notification Service (SNS), to build a S/4HANA business process extension project, and send out email notification if it is necessary by using Amazon Simple Notification Service.

This project showcases:

- Develop S/4HANA business process extension App by using [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model(CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) and [Fiori Element UI](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/03265b0408e2432c9571d6b3feb6b1fd)
- Consume S/4HANA On-Premise System Event by using [SAP Event Mesh](https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/df532e8735eb4322b00bfc7e42f84e8d.html)
- Consume S/4AHANA On-Premise System OData API From SAP Business Technology Platform (Cloud Env)
- Send Out Email Notification by leveraging [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html)

## Business Scenario
There is a third-party firm/team responsible for validating all newly created or changed business partners data in S/4HANA system for a company. This third-party firm/team will do the validation through a standalone S/4HANA business process extension App deployed on SAP BTP platform, instead of getting access into the S/4HANA system. 

In this standalone extension App, the validator could review the business partner's data, perform updates on the business partner address if necessary, and mark business partnerâ€™s validation status as NEW, IN PROCESS, VALID, and INVALID based on the condition. The validators could receive notifications through email whenever there is a business partner's data that needs to be validated. Once the business partner data are verified, the business partner get activated in the S/4HANA System.
